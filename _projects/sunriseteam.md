Sunrise is a professional eSports team focused on fortnite, which recently won $ 10K in the World Cup. Their site was built using React, with some additional modules for SEO optimization (react-helmet and react-snapshot). For now, this is the most complete project and I'm most proud of.

EDIT: although the 'sunrise' project has been abandoned by its creators, and therefore the website has lost all its usefulness, it remains a web-app that I am very proud of and have spent a lot of time on it. Thanks to this project I learned a lot of things about React.js and more generally about networking
