This site has been made with an eye on the covid situation: an intuitive and fast control panel has been developed from where the customer can update and modify the various menus according to the variation of the current restrictions.

The site was developed with the SSR "Hugo" and statically hosted on Netlify, in order to have maximum speed and minimum weight of the system, with a modern design consistent with the style of the restaurant.
