Encryptia is a platform that allows you to encrypt your texts using various algorithms.
This is a project designed both for cryptography enthusiasts who want to tinker with the various algorithm configurations via the web application, and for developers who need to encrypt data via the API.

It provides several of the best known algorithms, and is in continuous development to add new ones:

- DES
- Triple DES
- AES
- RSA
- MD5
- SHA (1, 224, 256, 384, 512)
