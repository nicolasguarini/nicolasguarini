                                Hi, I'm Nicolas and I'm a 19 years old developer.
                                I have always been passionate about computer science, ever since I was a child, I tried the historic Atari 2600, and love broke out.
                                I studied at I.S.I.S. J.M. Keynes in Varese, and now i'm studying Computer Science at Universit√† degli Studi dell'Insubria.
                            </p>
                            <p className="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">
                                I studied the latest web technologies like react, vue.js, django, node.js, express.js, flask and other static site generators such Gatsby.js and Hugo. 
                                While in the desktop environment I am still studying C ++ with the Qt library, C # and python. 
                                Lately I've also been entering the world of mobile, with java, react-native and flutter.
                            </p>
