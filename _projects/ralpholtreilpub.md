Ralph is a very convivial place where you can be enveloped by the sparkling poolside atmosphere on summer evenings, accompanied by music, cocktails, and excellent italian cuisine.

The website was created using the static site generator 'Hugo'. The NetlifyCMS administration panel was then connected to the site so that the customer can keep the site updated through a user-friendly interface. Everything is statically hosted on Netlify going to build a complete JAM stack.
