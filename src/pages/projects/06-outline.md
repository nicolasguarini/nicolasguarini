This project is made with the static site generator 'Hugo' and hosted by Netlify. It has nothing special in terms of web technologies or functionalities, but what makes me proud of this project is the design: not being a designer nor having studied to become one, I had little difficulty in designing something modern, captivating and in line with the style of OUTLINE, but with a lot of commitment and desire to do I managed to create a UI that I really like and which I am very proud of.
