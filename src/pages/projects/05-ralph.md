Ralph was the biggest customer I had and therefore the one I paid the most attention and attention to the smallest details. The website was created using the static site generator 'Hugo'. The NetlifyCMS administration panel was then connected to the site so that the customer can keep the site updated through a user-friendly interface. Everything is statically hosted on Netlify going to build a perfect JAM stack.
