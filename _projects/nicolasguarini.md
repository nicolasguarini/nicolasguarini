I created this site because I needed a place where I could exhibit my best projects in order to give an idea to those who don't know me about how I work, in what way and with what technologies.

Originally this site was done with Hugo, but one day I thought it was cool if I migrated it to Gatsby.js, as I was getting really into React, and so it was.
