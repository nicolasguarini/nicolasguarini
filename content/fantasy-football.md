description: "This is a fantasy football simulator written in python 3. I carried out this project during the internship at the LinkIT company. It was a very positive experience where I learned a lot of things like how to structure an object-oriented project in python and how to use Git.
In the game, the user can create teams where he can buy and sell players, create formations and more. Each team has a medium strength and games can be created between two teams."
