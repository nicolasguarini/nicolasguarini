                                    Hi, I'm Nicolas and I'm a 19 years old developer.
                                    I have always been passionate about computer science, ever since I was a child, I tried the historic Atari 2600, and love broke out.
                                    I studied at I.S.I.S. J.M. Keynes in Varese, and now i'm studying Computer Science at "Universit√† degli Studi dell'Insubria".
                                </p> 
                            </ReactWOW>
                            
                            <ReactWOW animation="fadeInUp" delay="0.8s">
                                <p>
                                    I studied the latest web technologies like react, vue.js, django, node.js, express.js, flask and other static site generators such Gatsby.js and Hugo. 
                                    While in the desktop environment I am still studying C ++ with the Qt library, C # and python. 
                                    Lately I've also been entering the world of mobile, with java, react-native and flutter.
                                </p>
                            </ReactWOW>

                                <p>
                                    Currently i'm studying the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), which I am finding extremely interesting and is making me passionate about the world of the backend
